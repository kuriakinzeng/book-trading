# Free Code Camp's Chart the Stock Market Basecamp Challenge

**tl;dr:** This app allows users visualize the recent trend lines for stocks

## User Stories:
1. I can view all books posted by every user.
2. I can add a new book.
3. I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
4. I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Architecture
The app is built on Express. It uses [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) as a boilerplate.

## Run locally
```npm install && npm run dev```
